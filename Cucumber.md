# InterviewPreparation
Question: Can you explain the difference between a Scenario Outline and a Data Table in Cucumber? How would you use each in a testing scenario?
Answer Expectation: The candidate should explain that Scenario Outline is used for running the same scenario with different sets of data, and Data Tables are used to pass multiple sets of data within a single step. 
They should also provide an example of when each would be appropriate.

Question: How do you handle shared step definitions across multiple feature files in a large Cucumber project?
Answer Expectation: The candidate should discuss organizing step definitions in a modular fashion, possibly using a base class or common step definition 
files to avoid duplication and maintain scalability.

Question: How do you use tags in Cucumber, and how would you run a specific set of tests using tags?
Answer Expectation: The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of Cucumber tags, explaining how to tag scenarios, and how to run tests selectively using 
tags with Cucumber options in the test runner.

Question: How do you implement parameterization in Cucumber to handle dynamic data in your test cases?
Answer Expectation: The candidate should describe using Cucumber's ability to pass parameters in step definitions using regular expressions or Cucumber expressions, 
and give examples of parameterized steps.

Question: How would you integrate Cucumber tests with Jenkins for continuous integration, and what challenges might you face?
Answer Expectation: The candidate should explain how to set up a Jenkins job to run Cucumber tests, possibly discussing plugins like Cucumber-JVM Reports for reporting. They should also touch on handling dependencies, 
setting up the environment, and dealing with test failures.
