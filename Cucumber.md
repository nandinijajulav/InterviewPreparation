Question: Can you explain the difference between a Scenario Outline and a Data Table in Cucumber? How would you use each in a testing scenario?

<p style="font-size:50px;">Answer Scenario Outline runs the same scenario with multiple data sets using placeholders, while Data Tables pass complex data within a single step. Use Scenario Outline for varied inputs; use Data Tables for detailed data within one scenario.</p>

Question: How do you handle shared step definitions across multiple feature files in a large Cucumber project?

Answer: Organize shared step definitions into common or base classes to avoid duplication. Use package structures to group related steps logically, ensuring reusability across multiple feature files while maintaining a clean and scalable project structure.

Question: How do you use tags in Cucumber, and how would you run a specific set of tests using tags?

Answer In Cucumber, tags are used to categorize scenarios or feature files, allowing you to selectively run specific tests. You can assign tags by placing @TagName above a scenario, feature, or step.

Question: How do you implement parameterization in Cucumber to handle dynamic data in your test cases?

Answer Implement parameterization in Cucumber by using placeholders in step definitions with regular expressions or Cucumber expressions. This allows dynamic data input, enabling the same step to run with different data sets.

Question: How would you integrate Cucumber tests with Jenkins for continuous integration, and what challenges might you face?

Answer Integrate Cucumber with Jenkins by configuring a Jenkins job to run Cucumber tests using Maven or Gradle. Challenges include managing dependencies, setting up test environments, handling parallel execution, and generating detailed test reports.
